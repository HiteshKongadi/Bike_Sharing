## General Information
- It is required to understand what are possible features having direct impact on the target variable.
- Background of your Assignment -> To understand the factors affecting bike sharing services.
- Business problem solution -> Predict the trend of bike sharing services for the near future so that the company can equip themselves to provide better reachability and services.
- The dataset used -> The data is provided by the company with all the possible variables impacting the usage of bike sharing service.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The r2 score of 81% was obtained on the Training dataset when compared to Test dataset it was 77%, which is a decent prediction from the model.
- It was observed that the service had seen an improvement in 2019 in comparision to 2018 which indicates the sharing service was gaining popularity.
- The services were most frequently availed in the month on January and September, mostly on Monday's.
